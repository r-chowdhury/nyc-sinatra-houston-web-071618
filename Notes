Build a history site for NYC

3 Models: Landmark, Title, Figure
Titles and figures have a many to many relationship, so we'll need a join table

It's a history app that focuses on historical figures.
View pages for al of the landmarks and a user will be able to create a new landmark but when a user creates or edits a figure,
they should also be able to select or create a new landmark and/or title to associate to that figure.

The form for a new figure and the form to edit a figure should allow the user to select from existing landmarks and title and create new
landmarks and titles to associate to the figure.
